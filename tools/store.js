var briefHistory = {
"The Adventure Begins" : "In 1907, a British army officer named Robert Baden-Powell had an idea that would change the world. He wrote a book called (Scouting for Boys,) which outlined his vision for a youth organization that emphasized outdoor skills, citizenship, and character development. Little did he know that this book would spark a global movement.",

"The First Troop" :
"In 1908, Baden-Powell formed the first Scout troop in England, with a group of energetic and curious boys. They met in a park, where they learned about camping, hiking, and first aid. The boys loved it, and soon, more troops began to form.",

"Scouting Goes Global" : "As Scouting spread across the globe, it encountered some hilarious cultural misunderstandings. In Japan, Scouts were initially confused by the concept of camping – they thought it meant sleeping in a tent in the middle of Tokyo! Meanwhile, in Africa, Scouts had to adapt to the challenges of the savannah, where lions and elephants roamed free",


"The World Organization of the Scout Movement":
"In 1920, the World Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM) was founded to coordinate Scouting activities globally. It was a bit like herding cats, but eventually, they got everyone on the same page. Today, WOSM has over 200 member countries and territories.",

"Scouting in Kenya" : "In the 1950s, Scouting took off in Kenya, with the formation of the Kenya Scouts Association. Kenyan Scouts were known for their bravery and resourcefulness, earning the nickname 'Simba Scouts' (Simba means 'lion' in Swahili).",

"Modern Scouting" : "Today, Scouting is more diverse and inclusive than ever. Scouts come from all walks of life, and the organization has adapted to the changing needs of young people. From environmental conservation to social justice, Scouts are tackling the big issues of our time.",

"Fun Facts and Figures" :
 "Scouting has over 50 million members worldwide – that's a lot of Scouts!, The Scout Promise and Law are translated into over 200 languages – talk about linguistic skills!, Scouting has been recognized by the United Nations for its contributions to peace, human rights, and sustainable development – we're making a difference!. And that's the story of Scouting in a nutshell! From its humble beginnings in England to its global reach today, Scouting has been an adventure like no other."

var bidenPowel = "The founder of the Scout Movement was LordBaden-Powell (BP). His common name wasRobert Stephen Smith. He was born on February 22, 1857 in England. He went to school like any other normal child and in his adulthood took up a career as a soldier. While he was in the British Army he served mainly in India and South Africa. Baden-Powell was sent to South Africa to fight the Anglo-Boer War, which threatened the British and Dutch settlers. BP and his soldiers were trapped by their enemy at a place in South Africa called “Mafeking,” the supply centre for the British. They were besieged without sufficient supplies of food, water and ammunition. To find assistance and supplies, BP had to be resourceful. He transported hidden messages inside of walking sticks. He used camouflage techniques to navigate the landscape unseen. He practiced these and other techniques with soldiers he named “Scouts.” When reinforcements eventually arrived, the siege had lasted for seven months. Yet during this time, none of his soldiers lost their lives from starvation or at the hand of the enemy. While in the Army, BP wrote articles recommending ways to train Scouts in the army. He later compiled these articles into a booklet entitled “Aids to Scouting.” It was published in England during the siege of Mafeking. The booklet inspired boys back home to organise themselves into groups called “Scouts.” BP reissued and simplified the ideas in the book “Aids to Scouting,” to suit younger people and wrote another book in 1908 entitled “Scouting For Boys.” While in South Africa, BP was given a Zulu name by the Matebele tribe called “Impesa” meaning “the wolf that does not sleep.” He adapted a form of left-handed handshake from a Zulu Chief. This was because the Zulu Chief used his right hand to hold his weapon. The connection between BP and Kenya is very strong. He visited Kenya for the first time in 1906. In 1935 he came for the second time and in 1937 came to spend an entire winter. In 1938 he made up his mind to live in Kenya. He settled in Nyeri and called his home”PAXTU.” “Pax” was the name of his home in England. “Tu” was a corruption of the word “too” in English. He lived in Kenya until his death on January 8, 1941. He was buried in Nyeri, in the compound of St. Peter’s Church. On February 22 of every year all Scouts celebrate the birthday of their Founder, Lord Baden-Powell. This day is called: “Founder’s Day.” It was by coincidence that he happened to share the same birthday with his wife. The Girl Guides call this day: “Thinking Day " ;
